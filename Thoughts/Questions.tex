    \item Why is a local ring called local? 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item (My guess is that this name is motivated by what is written on page 40 - Local properties)
        \end{itemize}
    \item What about a residue field?
    \item Does a prime element make sense outside of a unique factorisation domain? If it does, will the ideal generated by the prime element itself be prime.  
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If the definition runs something like an element with no non-unit divisors, then no, since $x=ap=bq$ with $a,p,b,q$ prime might occur.
        \item (I think so, I think outside of a UFD it just loses uniqueness)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Why do prime ideals containing an ideal correspond to prime ideals in the quotient ring of that ideal. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 
            %Irrelevant: We are considering $V(\mathfrak{q})\cong \text{Spec}(A/\mathfrak{q})$ I think. Relevant: If $\mathfrak{p}\subset V(\mathfrak{q})$, then $\mathfrak{p}\supset \mathfrak{q}$. Now, consider $\varphi:A\to A/\mathfrak{q}$. Then, we know that $\varphi(\mathfrak{p})\subset A/\mathfrak{q}$ is an ideal, but do not know if it is prime. Consider $0\ne (ab+\mathfrak{q})\in \varphi(\mathfrak{p})$. Since $A/\mathfrak{q}$ is an integral domain, this implies that $ab\not\in\mathfrak{q}$. Since $\mathfrak{q}$ is an ideal, it follows that neither $a$ nor $b$ are in $\mathfrak{q}$, but since $ab\in\mathfrak{p}$, either $a$ or $b$ \textit{is} in $\mathfrak{p}$, and hence mapped to nonzero elements of $A/\mathfrak{q}$ by $\varphi$. It follows that $\varphi(\mathfrak{p})$ contains $a$ or (and?) $b$.

            We want to show that for an ideal $\mathfrak{q}\subset A$ (that is not necessarily prime) and $\mathfrak{p}\in V(\mathfrak{q})$, that $\varphi(\mathfrak{p})$ is prime in $A/\mathfrak{q}$.
            \\
            \\
            (Recall that $V(\mathfrak{p})=\{\mathfrak{r}\in\text{Spec}(A)\mid \mathfrak{r}\supset \mathfrak{p}\}$.)
            \\
            \\
            Let $\mathfrak{p}\in V(\mathfrak{q})$ and let $\varphi:A\to A/\mathfrak{q}$. We know that $\varphi(\mathfrak{p})$ is an ideal, we simply need to check if it is prime. Consider $(ab+\mathfrak{q})\in \varphi(\mathfrak{p})$. This means that for some $c\in \mathfrak{p}$, $\varphi(c)=ab+\mathfrak{q}$, i.e. $c=ab+d$ for some $d\in \mathfrak{q}$. But $\mathfrak{q}\subset \mathfrak{p}$, and these are abelian groups under addition, and hence $-d\in\mathfrak{p}$. This implies that $ab+d-d\in\mathfrak{p}$ and hence $ab\in\mathfrak{p}$. Since $\mathfrak{p}$ is prime, $a\in\mathfrak{p}$ or $b\in \mathfrak{p}$, and hence $a+\mathfrak{q}$ or $b+\mathfrak{q}$ is in $\varphi(\mathfrak{p})$ as desired.

            Didn't use this in the end, but its fun to think about: $A-A^\times = \bigcup_{\mathfrak{p}\in\text{Spec}(A)} \mathfrak{p}$.
