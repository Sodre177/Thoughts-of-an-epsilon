Basic concept review, dated.
\begin{itemize}
    \item An \emph{affine} $k$-algebra is finitely generated and reduced over $k$.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Being finitely generated in this context means there is a finite set of elements $x_i$ in the algebra such that every other element may be written as a polynomial of these $x_i$.
            \item Note that this induces the existence of a surjective algebra homomorphism from the polynomial ring $k[x_1,\dots,x_n]$.
            \item Being reduced means that the $k$-algebra has no nilpotent elements.
        \end{itemize}
